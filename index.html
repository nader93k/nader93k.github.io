                <h2>About Me</h2>
                I'm seeking to make a career in Data Science. It's what I'm passionate about, because it is the intersection of programming, 
              mathematics, AI, and domain specific knowledge of different business units. It all began with me being facsinated about philosophy. 
              AI is such a fancy playground for philosophy, and Data Science is such a colorful playground for AI.
                <br>
                I prefer being in a 
              business instead of universities, because I want to be in touch with different people, and experience teams and dynamic environments.

                        <li>
                            Working as a Data Scientist in an international Business Intelligence team, I am responsible for extracting
                          insights and reports from data for different business units. In order to perform my tasks, I train myself with 
                          domain specific knowledge related to each unit and study suitable Key Performance Metrics (KPMs) for them. I have also 
                          worked on creating machine learning predictive pipelines with an emphasis on automated ML and scheduling tools to
                          keep the process simple, efficient, and always capturing the recent trends in our data.
